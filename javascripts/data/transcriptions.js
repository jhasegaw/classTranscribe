var oliverTranscription2  = [{"start":"0:00","end":"0:03","text":"so let's talk more about this file descriptor"},{"start":"0:03","end":"0:05","text":"i'm going to make my program be a little bit more useful"},{"start":"0:05","end":"0:07","text":"by printing out \"hello world\" a few times"},{"start":"0:07","end":"0:12","text":"so for example have a vraible count here"},{"start":"0:12","end":"0:17","text":"and a little for loop so i'll start with count =5"},{"start":"0:17","end":"0:19","text":"is count > 0"},{"start":"0:19","end":"0:22","text":"each time around the loop we're going to decrement count"},{"start":"0:22","end":"0:26","text":"so in C there is no boolean type"},{"start":"0:26","end":"0:32","text":"instead if I've got an int value which is non 0 that is treated as a true value"},{"start":"0:32","end":"0:39","text":"so I could actually write this more tersely by saying 'hey count'"},{"start":"0:39","end":"0:38","text":"meaning is count a non-0 value"},{"start":"0:38","end":"0:49","text":"and if you compare two things, you'll learn that with an int value of either 0 or 1 they are either the same or different"},{"start":"0:49","end":"0:51","text":"so we're going to print out \"hello world\" 5 times"},{"start":"0:51","end":"0:56","text":"and I want to show you just a little idea here"},{"start":"0:56","end":"1:02","text":"I've got 2 file descriptors which are valid when my program starts"},{"start":"1:02","end":"1:05","text":"and they are called 1 and 2"},{"start":"1:05","end":"1:09","text":"so why might it be useful to have 2 output streams?"},{"start":"1:09","end":"1:14","text":"we'll you can imagine we have a program that is calculating something"},{"start":"1:14","end":"1:18","text":"for example it's thinking of something to say or it's going to write to a file"},{"start":"1:18","end":"1:22","text":"but we may also want to display some error messages back to the user"},{"start":"1:22","end":"1:25","text":"or we might want to print some progress information"},{"start":"1:25","end":"1:33","text":"the first output stream identified by 1 is the standard output"},{"start":"1:33","end":"1:38","text":"and the second one is reserved for error messages"},{"start":"1:38","end":"1:47","text":"let's for example use this. instead of error messages we'll have a little dot"},{"start":"1:47","end":"1:46","text":"we'll run this"},{"start":"1:46","end":"1:52","text":"and if we've got everything correct we should see \"Hello\""},{"start":"1:52","end":"2:01","text":"ok, now, why do we see ./lib?"},{"start":"2:01","end":"2:06","text":"because we said I'm going to give you a pointer and I want you to take"},{"start":"2:06","end":"2:11","text":"the 6 bytes from it, so next 6 characters"},{"start":"2:11","end":"2:19","text":"and we just got whatever happened to be in memory after our ."},{"start":"2:19","end":"2:23","text":"so we only want the dot, so lets change that and run it again"},{"start":"2:23","end":"2:30","text":"and great, we've got \"Hello\" and \".Hello\""},{"start":"2:30","end":"2:31","text":"so right now both the standard output and standard error are going to different places"},{"start":"2:31","end":"2:37","text":"so we can actually change that over here in the console before we start a program"},{"start":"2:37","end":"2:42","text":"our terminal can control where the different output goes"},{"start":"2:42","end":"2:47","text":"so for example I might say I want to take the standard output and put that into a file"},{"start":"2:47","end":"2:49","text":"so \"output.txt\" "},{"start":"2:49","end":"2:58","text":"if I run this before the program starts I'm going to redirect it's output into this new file"},{"start":"2:58","end":"2:59","text":"so what we see on the console output "},{"start":"2:59","end":"3:03","text":"is anything written to standard error"},{"start":"3:03","end":"3:04","text":"the standard output is inside \"output.txt\""},{"start":"3:04","end":"3:09","text":"to prove it let me have a look at that file"},{"start":"3:09","end":"3:11","text":"let me cat the file"},{"start":"3:11","end":"3:13","text":"so \"output.txt\""},{"start":"3:13","end":"3:14","text":"and here it is"},{"start":"3:14","end":"3:16","text":"it says Hello x 5"},{"start":"3:16","end":"3:19","text":"now, rather than writing 1 and 2 over here"},{"start":"3:19","end":"3:22","text":"perhaps we should have some constants"},{"start":"3:22","end":"3:26","text":"which signify what these values actually mean"},{"start":"3:26","end":"3:31","text":"we could start to #define things"},{"start":"3:31","end":"3:36","text":"so I'll have a STDOUT_FILENO 1"},{"start":"3:36","end":"3:43","text":"and STDERR_FILENO 2"},{"start":"3:43","end":"3:48","text":"so anytime you do #define you're talking to the preprocessor"},{"start":"3:48","end":"3:59","text":"to say \"hey, in the future if you come across this character sequence then replace it with this value\""},{"start":"3:59","end":"4:04","text":"so we can compile this, except I've got a surprise for you"},{"start":"4:04","end":"4:12","text":"which is that these particular macros are already defined inside unistd.h"},{"start":"4:12","end":"4:16","text":"so I don't actually need to define them here in my program"},{"start":"4:16","end":"4:19","text":"so that's my little program"},{"start":"4:19","end":"4:22","text":"you see it's got a return value of 0"},{"start":"4:22","end":"4:27","text":"which is a convention for being correct and no errors"},{"start":"4:27","end":"4:31","text":"but it's up to us, we could choose a different value"},{"start":"4:31","end":"4:34","text":"for example we could choose the value 42"},{"start":"4:34","end":"4:39","text":"and I don't see an output value"},{"start":"4:39","end":"4:45","text":"but I can find out what the last exit value of the last process was"},{"start":"4:45","end":"4:46","text":"let me print out"},{"start":"4:46","end":"4:50","text":"happens to be some special variables"},{"start":"4:50","end":"4:54","text":"so \"echo $?\""},{"start":"4:54","end":"4:59","text":"which means give me the exit value or status of the last command run"},{"start":"4:59","end":"5:05","text":"we've covered quite a bit of ground"},{"start":"5:05","end":"5:14","text":"we've talked about how in C any non-0 integer is considered true"},{"start":"5:14","end":"5:16","text":"and 0 is considered

go"},{"start":"3:18","end":"3:22","text":"alright so we will say that the user has read and write permission"},{"start":"3:22","end":"3:29","text":"okay so we will have

that"},{"start":"0:43","end":"0:45","text":"just by the keyword static"},{"start":"0:45","end":"0:51","text":"so for example if i were to just say okay i've got myself a static array out here outside of that method"},{"start":"0:51","end":"0:57","text":"then my array lives forever or at least for the length of my process"},{"start":"0:57","end":"1:01","text":"so that gets rid of the problem of

variable"},{"start":"1:13","end":"1:15","text":"it just changes the scoping"},{"start":"1:15","end":"1:27","text":"so as always that means simply that now the variable name array can only be connected to that piece of memory inside my little method"},{"start":"1:27","end":"1:33","text":"so it's just changing how the actual name of the variable is bound to the memory"},{"start":"1:33","end":"1:36","text":"so that's one method"},{"start":"1:36","end":"1:41","text":"but instead i want to talk about a completely different way which is to use

that storage space is found inside the program's heap"},{"start":"2:06","end":"2:09","text":"so for example if I want one hundred and twenty eight bytes I would say malloc one hundred and twenty eight"},{"start":"2:09","end":"2:14","text":"so this is going to give me a pointer to the very first byte"},{"start":"2:14","end":"2:18","text":"so let's store that inside my little character pointer

is zero or null or if i wanted to be really terse I could say if not result"},{"start":"2:44","end":"2:45","text":"in other words result is null"},{"start":"2:45","end":"2:49","text":"then just return a null pointer"},{"start":"2:49","end":"2:50","text":"i am not going to try and use it"},{"start":"2:50","end":"2:51","text":"it's not a valid pointer"},{"start":"2:51","end":"3:01","text":"otherwise let's put some things inside this and I could turn the current time and store it inside that array"},{"start":"3:01","end":"3:12","text":"so let me use a function called strcpy to put in the current time which is two fifty one pm"},{"start":"3:12","end":"3:22","text":"#include <string.h> let's run this"},{"start":"3:22","end":"3:31","text":"and my program calls currenttime creates some memory and then returns it"},{"start":"3:31","end":"3:32","text":"this is fantastic right"},{"start":"3:32","end":"3:34","text":"i've now got a way to make long lived pieces of memory and put data inside them"},{"start":"3:34","end":"3:40","text":"but with great opportunity comes great responsibility here "},{"start":"3:40","end":"3:51","text":"so what we should do is let our programs is with every malloc we should at some point free up that memory to say hey i've finished with it"},{"start":"3:51","end":"3:55","text":"so the correct way to do this is to keep a pointer around"},{"start":"3:55","end":"3:58","text":"so let's have a pointer down here"},{"start":"3:58","end":"4:00","text":"and when i finished using that memory"},{"start":"4:00","end":"4:02","text":"i can free it"},{"start":"4:02","end":"4:05","text":"to say hey this memory is no longer being used"},{"start":"4:05","end":"4:09","text":"this block of memory of one hundred and twenty eight bytes is no longer being used"},{"start":"4:09","end":"4:17","text":"please put it back into the heap and maybe we will reuse that memory again for a future malloc"},{"start":"4:17","end":"4:23","text":"so

first"},{"start":"0:23","end":"0:26","text":"so it's going to return a pointer to a link"},{"start":"0:26","end":"0:36","text":"and i might call it say link_create and I'll expect a key and I'll expect a value"},{"start":"0:36","end":"0:40","text":"so that'll give me two pointers"},{"start":"0:40","end":"0:50","text":"if i wish to debug this I could have a printf in here saying hey creating

from the heap because we want our link to last for a long time until we decide to destroy it"},{"start":"1:01","end":"1:10","text":"so i'll say malloc give me some memory and how much well i better ask for how big is my memory structure link_t"},{"start":"1:10","end":"1:16","text":"and i will cast that return type as a pointer to my link objectg"},{"start":"1:16","end":"1:18","text":"why do i do that"},{"start":"1:18","end":"1:21","text":"well i want to be able to reference the sub parts"},{"start":"1:21","end":"1:22","text":"the components of my struct"},{"start":"1:22","end":"1:29","text":"and i will call that say result and i need to initialize my pointer"},{"start":"1:29","end":"1:38","text":"so now i've got that I can set the key to be a

link"},{"start":"2:03","end":"2:19","text":"well that's fine if I knew for example that this will always be used for string constants or I am taking control of those values that I send in and I happen to know that their lifetime is longer than the links lifetime"},{"start":"2:19","end":"2:25","text":"so if that's the case then my code is relatively simple like this"},{"start":"2:25","end":"2:28","text":"and destroying the link is also relatively simple"},{"start":"2:28","end":"2:31","text":"so let's write a link destroy method destroy"},{"start":"2:31","end":"2:36","text":"which takes a pointer to the link that is going to disappear so we can call that just p"},{"start":"2:36","end":"2:39","text":"and what do i need to do in here"},{"start":"2:39","end":"2:42","text":"well i can simply return the memory back"},{"start":"2:42","end":"2:47","text":"okay so this works we could do a little better than this"},{"start":"2:47","end":"2:49","text":"we could actually do some defensive programming here"},{"start":"2:49","end":"2:55","text":"where we also destroy the information inside that link"},{"start":"2:55","end":"2:59","text":"so for that i can use memory set"},{"start":"2:59","end":"3:03","text":"so memset where I give it a pointer that I want to use"},{"start":"3:03","end":"3:08","text":"the value will be zero the number of bytes can be the size of my link"},{"start":"3:08","end":"3:12","text":"so this assures that i don't have any dangling

set to null"},{"start":"3:19","end":"3:27","text":"so if someone happens to have a pointer to this link and they try to use the contents straight away then it will fail it will be null"},{"start":"3:27","end":"3:31","text":"and secondly we are freeing it to say okay this memory can now be reused for other purposes"},{"start":"3:31","end":"3:35","text":"so that's my link destroy method"},{"start":"3:35","end":"3:42","text":"now suppose we discover that our strings we don't control the lifetime of these string arrays"},{"start":"3:42","end":"3:45","text":"and that actually we should make copies of them"},{"start":"3:45","end":"3:46","text":"so how can i do that"},{"start":"3:46","end":"3:58","text":"well there's a method called strdup so let's do that strdup and this gives me back a pointer to a new string "},{"start":"3:58","end":"4:01","text":"a new character array that has been created on the heap"},{"start":"4:01","end":"4:07","text":"and it's just a copy of that

destroy the link I better free up the memory associated with my key and value"},{"start":"4:18","end":"4:24","text":"so before ending here I should free up those pointers"},{"start":"4:24","end":"4:33","text":"so I should call free on my key and free on my value pointer as well"},{"start":"4:33","end":"4:46","text":"okay so there's my code now to start working with a link"},{"start":"4:46","end":"4:52","text":"with my main method I will need to always know the beginning of my linked list"},{"start":"4:52","end":"4:57","text":"so that sounds like a great thing to actually have as a global variable here"},{"start":"4:57","end":"5:02","text":"so let me have my link pointer here and I can call it root"},{"start":"5:02","end":"5:07","text":"and so the first link I make I can initialize root to that"},{"start":"5:07","end":"5:09","text":"to that very first link"},{"start":"5:09","end":"5:16","text":"okay so that's it for now, it's now time for you

it immediately to check inside part of a while loop or an if statement"},{"start":"0:57","end":"1:00","text":"so we've got a little character loop here that is going to keep going until it gets to the

one"},{"start":"1:42","end":"1:48","text":"right so why don't we use our little program to print out the contents of another file"},{"start":"1:48","end":"1:52","text":"so if I cat my source code I can see the contents of that"},{"start":"1:52","end":"1:55","text":"great so I'm going to pipe it into my program"},{"start":"1:55","end":"2:05","text":"so i'll do ./program and it reads every byte

character"},{"start":"2:13","end":"2:19","text":"so what we'll do is say if c is at least thirty two in other words at least a space an ascii space"},{"start":"2:19","end":"2:26","text":"and if it is

typing you by the way you can do control d"},{"start":"2:50","end":"2:55","text":"now see this working on some actual source code"},{"start":"2:55","end":"3:01","text":"so let's here some text my program.c and i'm going to pipe that into my program to use as its input"},{"start":"3:01","end":"3:06","text":"and you can see great we've garbled the program"},{"start":"3:06","end":"3:13","text":"so if I want to I can then take that output and pipe it into my program again"},{"start":"3:13","end":"3:19","text":"so now i'm going to unencrypt it because i flipped the lowest bit back  "},{"start":"3:19","end":"3:19","text":"so we get back our source code"},{"start":"3:19","end":"3:25","text":"so that's getchar and putchar i can also work with whole lines"},{"start":"3:25","end":"3:41","text":"i can let's get rid of the loop here i can say puts hello or any pointer to a character array provided its terminated by a zero byte at the

input"},{"start":"4:05","end":"4:12","text":"but this has a problem and we'll see why in a moment why this function call is actually being removed from the c standard"},{"start":"4:12","end":"4:22","text":"i'm talking about gets so let's call gets and we will have a little buffer here"},{"start":"4:22","end":"4:24","text":"so let's put a little buffer on the stack here"},{"start":"4:24","end":"4:27","text":"i'll make it twelve bytes today "},{"start":"4:27","end":"4:32","text":"and remember when we call gets with buffer if you use the array name you are talking about the very first byte of the array"},{"start":"4:32","end":"4:35","text":"and rather than printing out hello"},{"start":"4:35","end":"4:38","text":"we will print out our buffer value"},{"start":"4:38","end":"4:46","text":"so let's run this and we can type something in and it echos it back to us"},{"start":"4:46","end":"4:50","text":"fantastic but what happens if we enter more than twelve bytes"},{"start":"4:50","end":"4:54","text":"so in other words could something bad happen to our other variables"},{"start":"4:54","end":"5:00","text":"well yes it could because if we go past twelve bytes we start writing into memory which is used for other purposes"},{"start":"5:00","end":"5:05","text":"for example in my little program the integer is immediately after the buffer"},{"start":"5:05","end":"5:13","text":"let's prove this let's set our hex value of c to be ten twenty thirty fourty"},{"start":"5:13","end":"5:19","text":"let me print that out after we've called gets i'm going to print it again"},{"start":"5:19","end":"5:29","text":"so we've got to remember that what we store is going to be our letters plus a null byte"},{"start":"5:29","end":"5:42","text":"so in this case if I do ABCDABCDABCD I've already overflowed because the thirteenth byte is now going to be written into my integer"},{"start":"5:42","end":"5:46","text":"but i am going to do just a few more I'll do ABCD there we go"},{"start":"5:46","end":"5:51","text":"and we'll see that I've managed to change my integer value to 41424344"},{"start":"5:51","end":"5:56","text":"so the last ABC that I wrote in there actually overran my buffer"},{"start":"5:56","end":"6:01","text":"i've got a buffer overflow and I've corrupted the contents of another variable"},{"start":"6:01","end":"6:03","text":"so that's why gets is dangerous"},{"start":"6:03","end":"6:10","text":"there's no way to tell gets that we shouldn't accept input that is too long for it"},{"start":"6:10","end":"6:18","text":"so in a future video i'll tell you about getline and also fgets which don't suffer from these

address of this variable"},{"start":"2:06","end":"2:09","text":"so we're going to say ampersand score"},{"start":"2:09","end":"2:14","text":"so, lets read that and we'll print it out"},{"start":"2:14","end":"2:23","text":"so here's the result and we'll say %s %d and we'll print the contents of the buffer and print the value of score"},{"start":"2:23","end":"2:29","text":"so notice that scanf and printf, the arguments don't always look the same"},{"start":"2:29","end":"2:33","text":"when we want to print out the values, we don't actually want to just print out the address of score"},{"start":"2:33","end":"2:36","text":"we actually wanted to know what the value is"},{"start":"2:36","end":"2:38","text":"so that read that correctly"},{"start":"2:38","end":"2:45","text":"scanf actually tells us something else which is how many arguments it correctly managed to parse"},{"start":"2:45","end":"2:49","text":"so let's make a note of that and we'll print that out"},{"start":"2:49","end":"2:52","text":"so, we'll say %d here"},{"start":"2:52","end":"2:58","text":"print out the result in our printf statement here"},{"start":"2:58","end":"3:04","text":"so now when we run it, we'll see that sscanf managed to read both iterms"},{"start":"3:04","end":"3:06","text":"I got result two"},{"start":"3:06","end":"3:12","text":"fantastic. so that's useful. now we can write robust programs to check if we really did write into both variables"},{"start":"3:12","end":"3:18","text":"now you might be worried that scanf could result in a buffer overflow"},{"start":"3:18","end":"3:21","text":"and, in fact, in our current code, you'd be right"},{"start":"3:21","end":"3:26","text":"so if I had a very long name with no spaces here"},{"start":"3:26","end":"3:31","text":"then that's longer than our buffer"},{"start":"3:31","end":"3:35","text":"so what we need to do is tell scanf just how big our buffer is"},{"start":"3:35","end":"3:38","text":"so in this case, it should be nineteen"},{"start":"3:38","end":"3:42","text":"because we're setting scanf how many character to read from the input"},{"start":"3:42","end":"3:50","text":"and our buf, of course, if going to need one extra one to hold the terminating byte for this string"},{"start":"3:50","end":"3:51","text":"so let's run this now"},{"start":"3:51","end":"4:04","text":"and you'll see that first of all the name is truncated and that secondly, the return value of our scanf call here was one"},{"start":"4:04","end":"4:10","text":"and it only managed to read into the buffer"},{"start":"4:10","end":"4:11","text":"it gave up trying to read the integer because our buffer wasn't long enough"},{"start":"4:11","end":"4:17","text":"and, in fact, our score variable still contained its original value"},{"start":"4:17","end":"4:19","text":"negative forty two"},{"start":"4:19","end":"4:24","text":"so good defensive programs must check that the return value is reasonable"},{"start":"4:24","end":"4:37","text":"also, when writing scanf or sscanf or fscanf, it's always a good idea to carefully check to see whether you should be looking at the address of the variable or if the variable itself actually is a pointer"},{"start":"4:37","end":"4:44","text":"and is already going to give you the memory address that you'd like scanf to change"},{"start":"4:44","end":"4:48","text":"alright so we've read data from a string "},{"start":"4:48","end":"5:00","text":"we can also parse data from a file stream and how can we do that? you can use not sscanf but fscanf"},{"start":"5:00","end":"5:03","text":"and if you did that, you better give it a file stream"},{"start":"5:03","end":"5:06","text":"there's one called stdin already"},{"start":"5:06","end":"5:14","text":"if we didn't want to use that, then we could open up a file using fopen and then pass in the file handle here"},{"start":"5:14","end":"5:25","text":"and reading from stdin is such a common occurance that in fact there's another form of this which is just say scanf"},{"start":"5:25","end":"5:29","text":"and if you do that, that means \"hey, just read from stdin\""},{"start":"5:29","end":"5:33","text":"now, let's run our program here"},{"start":"5:33","end":"5:39","text":"and, now it's waiting for input"},{"start":"5:39","end":"5:40","text":"so let me typing something"},{"start":"5:40","end":"5:44","text":"I'll say \"Angrave one hundred\""},{"start":"5:44","end":"5:50","text":"great! and it managed to parse both variables"},{"start":"5:50","end":"5:53","text":"so that's enough introduction to scanf"},{"start":"5:53","end":"6:02","text":"remember this next time you're trying to read 3d data and points and you want to say convert those ASCII into actual floats and doubles"},{"start":"6:02","end":"6:14","text":"and also remember that its important to read exactly how scanf uses these format specifiers because its not quite the same as printf"},{"start":"6:14","end":"6:14","text":"alright, that's it for me. time for you to play. bye!"},{"start":"6:14","end":"6:15","text":"for now"}];
var bobTranscription18    = [{"start":"0:00","end":"0:01","text":"hello welcome"},{"start":"0:01","end":"0:03","text":"let's talk about getline"},{"start":"0:03","end":"0:10","text":"so it's very common to read in a single line of text either from the user or from a file"},{"start":"0:10","end":"0:17","text":"and we would like it to be very easy to say hey let's not worry about making sure my buffer is large enough"},{"start":"0:17","end":"0:20","text":"i just want to get the whole line"},{"start":"0:20","end":"0:21","text":"and this getline was born"},{"start":"0:21","end":"0:24","text":"this is being adopted into the posix standard"},{"start":"0:24","end":"0:31","text":"if you are working however with an old standard and an older compiler we have to ask gcc to explicitly enable it"},{"start":"0:31","end":"0:40","text":"so before doing our includes with stdio we need to define _GNU_SOURCE"},{"start":"0:40","end":"0:48","text":"so if we do that we would like the gnu source additions to the standard functions"},{"start":"0:48","end":"0:54","text":"right so if we do that now we have got a getline declaration included as part of the #include <stdio.h>"},{"start":"0:54","end":"0:58","text":"so here is how we can use getline"},{"start":"0:58","end":"1:03","text":"with getline we actually set up two variables"},{"start":"1:03","end":"1:07","text":"we get getline to manipulate these directly "},{"start":"1:07","end":"1:12","text":"we are going to have a pointer to a buffer"},{"start":"1:12","end":"1:18","text":"and a little int to say how big is our buffer"},{"start":"1:18","end":"1:24","text":"well let's just check to see really if it is an int or if we should be doing a different type"},{"start":"1:24","end":"1:30","text":"so let me pull up my favorite manpage for getline"},{"start":"1:30","end":"1:34","text":"so actually the correct type to use is size_t"},{"start":"1:34","end":"1:40","text":"which is essentially an unsigned int or larger on some systems"},{"start":"1:40","end":"1:39","text":"so let's just make a note of that"},{"start":"1:39","end":"1:44","text":"that is the declaration that we are going to be using"},{"start":"1:44","end":"1:49","text":"and so we will have not just a buffer to our character array"},{"start":"1:49","end":"1:53","text":"but also size as well to say how big is our buffer"},{"start":"1:53","end":"1:56","text":"and i will call this say capacity"},{"start":"1:56","end":"2:00","text":"right so we could start calling this and we could say okay"},{"start":"2:00","end":"2:07","text":"get me a line and oh i need to pass in a pointer to my buffer variable"},{"start":"2:07","end":"2:13","text":"right and notice that the declaration here is star star asteric so it's a pointer to a pointer"},{"start":"2:13","end":"2:17","text":"right so how did i get that"},{"start":"2:17","end":"2:21","text":"i say okay give me the address of my variable"},{"start":"2:21","end":"2:23","text":"and similarly for the capacity as well"},{"start":"2:23","end":"2:26","text":"the size of the variable"},{"start":"2:26","end":"2:29","text":"so give me the address of my capacity"},{"start":"2:29","end":"2:34","text":"and getline is going to modify those two variables directly"},{"start":"2:34","end":"2:37","text":"essentially if my buffer is not large enough"},{"start":"2:37","end":"2:44","text":"it is going to free up the old buffer and then call malloc so that we get a larger buffer"},{"start":"2:44","end":"2:49","text":"okay technically it might call realloc but let's not worry about exactly which library call it calls"},{"start":"2:49","end":"2:55","text":"we just know that it's going to do all that buffer maintenance for us automatically"},{"start":"2:55","end":"3:01","text":"and now we need to give it a filestream so why don't we use say stdin"},{"start":"3:01","end":"3:09","text":"so right now our code suffers from a terrible flaw which is that we've assumed that our automatic variables buffer capacity will be set to nothing"},{"start":"3:09","end":"3:15","text":"so the getline knows that it cannot use what it happens to be pointing to"},{"start":"3:15","end":"3:19","text":"so we actually need to set these to explicitly to null and the capacity to zero"},{"start":"3:19","end":"3:25","text":"so the first time we call getline getline will see that the buffer is certainly not large enough and will allocate enough space"},{"start":"3:25","end":"3:36","text":"we can now find out what the result is which is the number of characters getline has managed to retrieve"},{"start":"3:36","end":"3:38","text":"or a negative value if it failed"},{"start":"3:38","end":"3:40","text":"so let's make a note of that"},{"start":"3:40","end":"3:42","text":"and we'll print this out"},{"start":"3:42","end":"3:50","text":"so i'll print out an integer and let's have a look to see what we can find inside our buffer"},{"start":"3:50","end":"3:52","text":"so we want the result and we want the buffer"},{"start":"3:52","end":"3:56","text":"and lastly let's put a newline here"},{"start":"3:56","end":"3:59","text":"okay so we'll run our little program here"},{"start":"3:59","end":"4:04","text":"and now it's waiting for me to type something"},{"start":"4:04","end":"4:11","text":"okay great so it says i have got six characters"},{"start":"4:11","end":"4:14","text":"wait and i printed ABCDE"},{"start":"4:14","end":"4:19","text":"actually the last character might be a newline character"},{"start":"4:19","end":"4:20","text":"and quite often we don't actually need that"},{"start":"4:20","end":"4:26","text":"so why don't we overwrite the very last character with null with a terminating byte"},{"start":"4:26","end":"4:29","text":"so let's write the code for that"},{"start":"4:29","end":"4:34","text":"first of all we only want to do that if we get at least one character back from getline"},{"start":"4:34","end":"4:39","text":"so let's check that the result was positive"},{"start":"4:39","end":"4:44","text":"and also we only want to do this if we are going to overwrite the last character which truly is a newline"},{"start":"4:44","end":"4:52","text":"we could imagine for example reading from a file where the very last byte is not actually a newline"},{"start":"4:52","end":"4:54","text":"so we should just check to see what we're going to write here"},{"start":"4:54","end":"4:59","text":"so let's look inside our buffer and where do we want to look "},{"start":"4:59","end":"5:04","text":"well if we read one character than that would be at the beginning of the buffer"},{"start":"5:04","end":"5:07","text":"so we need to look at result minus one"},{"start":"5:07","end":"5:11","text":"so if that is equal to the character of a newline"},{"start":"5:11","end":"5:16","text":"then let's truncate the string"},{"start":"5:16","end":"5:20","text":"the easiest way to do that remember is strings are just terminated by zero"},{"start":"5:20","end":"5:23","text":"so let's just put a zero directly into that byte"},{"start":"5:23","end":"5:28","text":"so we are going to say at the same spot set that equal to zero"},{"start":"5:28","end":"5:31","text":"right so let's run our program again"},{"start":"5:31","end":"5:45","text":"okay so this time it read it correctly and our printf we didn't get that unwanted extra newline"},{"start":"5:45","end":"5:50","text":"alright our program right now is allocating memory on the heap"},{"start":"5:50","end":"5:52","text":"we don't do it we let getline do it"},{"start":"5:52","end":"5:57","text":"but it's actually up to us when we finish getline to free that buffer"},{"start":"5:57","end":"6:00","text":"right so let's do that"},{"start":"6:00","end":"6:03","text":"at the very end here we can call free on the buffer"},{"start":"6:03","end":"6:14","text":"we don't need to do that every time we call getline because getline by default will try to for performance try to reuse the buffer for each line it gets"},{"start":"6:14","end":"6:21","text":"so for example we could call getline twice and it would try to use the same buffer"},{"start":"6:21","end":"6:24","text":"but the big take home message is first of all"},{"start":"6:24","end":"6:32","text":"you are going to need a pointer to a buffer and a capacity buffer which getline itself is going to change the contents of"},{"start":"6:32","end":"6:37","text":"as you call it it can make the buffer as large as"},{"start":"6:37","end":"6:43","text":"each time you call getline it might change that buffer to point to some new memory if the buffer needs to be larger"},{"start":"6:43","end":"6:51","text":"secondly it's a great idea to check the return value of getline to see how many characters it managed to read"},{"start":"6:51","end":"6:54","text":"and also to see if there was an error or not"},{"start":"6:54","end":"7:01","text":"and the return type for that is ssize_t for a signed integer type"},{"start":"7:01","end":"7:10","text":"and finally it's good practice to don't forget to free the memory that is pointed at by your buffer variable"},{"start":"7:10","end":"7:10","text":"okay that's it for me"},{"start":"7:10","end":"7:10","text":"have fun playing"},{"start":"7:10","end":"7:10","text":"bye"}];
var bobTranscription19    = [{"start":"0:00","end":"0:02","text":"Hello welcome"},{"start":"0:02","end":"0:05","text":"so this video is a little introduction to signals"},{"start":"0:05","end":"0:08","text":"so signals are like a software interrupt"},{"start":"0:08","end":"0:13","text":"we can use them to control our processes and even do things asynchronously"},{"start":"0:13","end":"0:18","text":"so let's have a look at a little program i have written so far that doesn't use signals yet"},{"start":"0:18","end":"0:23","text":"all it does is ask for the environment of home"},{"start":"0:23","end":"0:25","text":"in other words the user's home directory"},{"start":"0:25","end":"0:29","text":"and then we have a little loop that prints it out and sleeps for three seconds"},{"start":"0:29","end":"0:34","text":"so every three seconds it is going to print out my home directory"},{"start":"0:34","end":"0:38","text":"and on this machine i am root so it just keeps on printing out slash root"},{"start":"0:38","end":"0:44","text":"so of course we can stop this program by pressing control c"},{"start":"0:44","end":"0:48","text":"and when you do that you actually are sending a signal"},{"start":"0:48","end":"0:53","text":"sigint or sig interrupt to the process"},{"start":"0:53","end":"0:56","text":"now maybe it might be that our process might not like being interrupted"},{"start":"0:56","end":"1:00","text":"why don't we catch that signal and install our own little handle for that"},{"start":"1:00","end":"1:02","text":"so here is how we will do this"},{"start":"1:02","end":"1:16","text":"i am going to say at the beginning of my program that if you get a certain signal say sigint "},{"start":"1:16","end":"1:21","text":"rather than having the default behavior which as we know is to stop the program or quit the program"},{"start":"1:21","end":"1:23","text":"let us run my code instead"},{"start":"1:23","end":"1:27","text":"so i will call it say nothankyou"},{"start":"1:27","end":"1:28","text":"so what is no thank you"},{"start":"1:28","end":"1:31","text":"it has to be a pointer to a function"},{"start":"1:31","end":"1:33","text":"how do we do that"},{"start":"1:33","end":"1:35","text":"easy just write a function"},{"start":"1:35","end":"1:39","text":"and in this case the correct type is something that doesn't return anything"},{"start":"1:39","end":"1:41","text":"but does take an integer"},{"start":"1:41","end":"1:45","text":"in fact it is the signal that is being sent to our program"},{"start":"1:45","end":"1:51","text":"and so that we know that this is being called let's write something out directly to standard output"},{"start":"1:51","end":"1:55","text":"so i can say write and i can say no"},{"start":"1:55","end":"1:59","text":"so what is that that is a little message of three bytes to send"},{"start":"1:59","end":"2:00","text":"so let's run this now"},{"start":"2:00","end":"2:04","text":"okay so here is my program every three seconds it is going to print root"},{"start":"2:04","end":"2:06","text":"but now i am going to press control c"},{"start":"2:06","end":"2:16","text":"and it prints no no so it's refusing to quit"},{"start":"2:16","end":"2:20","text":"you might also notice that the sleep also immediately returns"},{"start":"2:20","end":"2:21","text":"more about that later"},{"start":"2:21","end":"2:25","text":"it is still possible to stop our program here"},{"start":"2:25","end":"2:30","text":"if we do control backslash then we force it to quit"},{"start":"2:30","end":"2:34","text":"so sigint is one common signal that we send out programs"},{"start":"2:34","end":"2:35","text":"there are many others"},{"start":"2:35","end":"2:40","text":"just for fun let me show you one called sigalarm"},{"start":"2:40","end":"2:48","text":"so this time i am going to say alarm seven seconds"},{"start":"2:48","end":"2:57","text":"and so when you call alarm you are going to say give me a special signal called sigalrm in this many seconds"},{"start":"2:57","end":"2:59","text":"in seven seconds"},{"start":"2:59","end":"3:02","text":"and we better install then"},{"start":"3:02","end":"3:05","text":"well let's just run it and see what happens to begin with"},{"start":"3:05","end":"3:18","text":"so the default behavior of this sigalrm is to actually stop our program"},{"start":"3:18","end":"3:19","text":"it quits the program"},{"start":"3:19","end":"3:23","text":"that's a pretty aggressive alarm clock i think you'll agree"},{"start":"3:23","end":"3:26","text":"and it also as you see prints out alarm clock on the shell"},{"start":"3:26","end":"3:32","text":"perhaps we don't want our alarm signal to be so menacing"},{"start":"3:32","end":"3:37","text":"so this time instead of sigint i can say look for a certain signal called sigalrm"},{"start":"3:37","end":"3:40","text":"please call my function instead"},{"start":"3:40","end":"3:57","text":"okay so here we go our alarm went off after four seconds and this time we asynchronously ran our code that printed out no to standard out"},{"start":"3:57","end":"3:59","text":"so this is pretty exciting right"},{"start":"3:59","end":"4:03","text":"you probably thought about interrupts on the hardware level"},{"start":"4:03","end":"4:09","text":"now we can do interrupts at the software level and we can respond to things which happen in our environment very quickly"},{"start":"4:09","end":"4:16","text":"so we will find signals to be very useful when we start dealing working with more than one process"},{"start":"4:16","end":"4:22","text":"we can control our programs and we can also work with very large amounts of data coming in"},{"start":"4:22","end":"4:23","text":"that is enough for me"},{"start":"4:23","end":"4:23","text":"bye"}];
var bobTranscription20    = [{"start":"0:00","end":"0:05","text":"so usually we think about our programs as just turning into one single process"},{"start":"0:05","end":"0:08","text":"now i am going to show you some systems programming magic"},{"start":"0:08","end":"0:11","text":"where actually we can turn our single process into two"},{"start":"0:11","end":"0:13","text":"here is how we are going to do it"},{"start":"0:13","end":"0:16","text":"let us have a very simple program that says hello world"},{"start":"0:16","end":"0:19","text":"and here it is"},{"start":"0:19","end":"0:21","text":"so between these two lines however"},{"start":"0:21","end":"0:23","text":"i am going to call fork"},{"start":"0:23","end":"0:29","text":"and here's a surprise"},{"start":"0:29","end":"0:31","text":"we get hello world world"},{"start":"0:31","end":"0:32","text":"yes we get two worlds"},{"start":"0:32","end":"0:34","text":"why is that"},{"start":"0:34","end":"0:37","text":"well at the beginning there was a single process"},{"start":"0:37","end":"0:42","text":"but then we called fork and now our single process is actually being cloned"},{"start":"0:42","end":"0:44","text":"it has been split into two"},{"start":"0:44","end":"0:46","text":"so both the processes print out world"},{"start":"0:46","end":"0:50","text":"and so we see both their output on our little terminal here"},{"start":"0:50","end":"0:52","text":"okay what else can we do with this"},{"start":"0:52","end":"0:56","text":"so let us first of all show that there really are two different processes"},{"start":"0:56","end":"0:59","text":"i am going to look at their processor id"},{"start":"0:59","end":"1:03","text":"and we will print it out"},{"start":"1:03","end":"1:05","text":"so i will call getpid()"},{"start":"1:05","end":"1:10","text":"and you will see that yeah i have got two different processes"},{"start":"1:10","end":"1:12","text":"both trying to run at the same time"},{"start":"1:12","end":"1:16","text":"in fact i have got a parent child relationship here"},{"start":"1:16","end":"1:18","text":"i have got the original process"},{"start":"1:18","end":"1:20","text":"the parent"},{"start":"1:20","end":"1:26","text":"and you can think of fork as saying let us clone this original process right here right now"},{"start":"1:26","end":"1:28","text":"so that i get a child that looks just like me"},{"start":"1:28","end":"1:30","text":"or at least almost like me"},{"start":"1:30","end":"1:32","text":"in many many respects"},{"start":"1:32","end":"1:33","text":"it is the same memory"},{"start":"1:33","end":"1:35","text":"it has got it's own variables"},{"start":"1:35","end":"1:38","text":"but because its got its own address space"},{"start":"1:38","end":"1:44","text":"what the child now does in terms of its memory is seperate from the parents"},{"start":"1:44","end":"1:50","text":"okay so let's show you what we can then do with this"},{"start":"1:50","end":"1:53","text":"first of all fork actually returns something here"},{"start":"1:53","end":"1:55","text":"it actually returns back an id"},{"start":"1:55","end":"1:57","text":"so let's make a note of that"},{"start":"1:57","end":"1:59","text":"and we'll print it out"},{"start":"1:59","end":"2:05","text":"so we'll say %d and we'll print out just here"},{"start":"2:05","end":"2:10","text":"okay so here is what we see"},{"start":"2:10","end":"2:19","text":"that the process id 681 has fork value of 682"},{"start":"2:19","end":"2:24","text":"and process 682 has a fork return value of 0"},{"start":"2:24","end":"2:30","text":"so the fork value is different for the parent and the child"},{"start":"2:30","end":"2:33","text":"and in fact fork"},{"start":"2:33","end":"2:37","text":"if it returns a positive number is talking to the parent"},{"start":"2:37","end":"2:41","text":"and telling the parent here is the id number for your child"},{"start":"2:41","end":"2:44","text":"so let us make a note of that"},{"start":"2:44","end":"2:46","text":"let us call this child"},{"start":"2:46","end":"2:48","text":"here is my child"},{"start":"2:48","end":"2:49","text":"so i can call my child"},{"start":"2:49","end":"2:55","text":"and then i can write an if statement to decide if i am the parent or the newly created child or not"},{"start":"2:55","end":"3:05","text":"so we will say look if the childid what i return from fork is actually greater than 0"},{"start":"3:05","end":"3:07","text":"then i am the parent"},{"start":"3:07","end":"3:13","text":"so let us put something like hey i'm the grouchy parent"},{"start":"3:13","end":"3:29","text":"if it is zero however then hey I'm the carefree child!"},{"start":"3:29","end":"3:34","text":"so we will let's remove this "},{"start":"3:34","end":"3:36","text":"i'll get rid of that line now"},{"start":"3:36","end":"3:42","text":"okay so now we have a little program where the parent and child are going to do two different things"},{"start":"3:42","end":"3:48","text":"and in fact it is standard for the parent to wait for the child to finish"},{"start":"3:48","end":"3:55","text":"we don't have to but quite often we need the child process to do something for us"},{"start":"3:55","end":"3:56","text":"perhaps in the background"},{"start":"3:56","end":"4:01","text":"but we don't actually want to continue until the child has finished"},{"start":"4:01","end":"4:02","text":"so let us do that"},{"start":"4:02","end":"4:07","text":"what i am going to wait for my child to finish"},{"start":"4:07","end":"4:16","text":"so i am going to say waitpid and i need to say okay what is the id i need to wait on well here is the childid"},{"start":"4:16","end":"4:21","text":"and later on i can ask for some status information about my child"},{"start":"4:21","end":"4:24","text":"and for now the last argument i am just going to put as 0"},{"start":"4:24","end":"4:28","text":"so i need to have a variable called status"},{"start":"4:28","end":"4:35","text":"and in fact we are going to pass not just the value of status but the address of our little variable"},{"start":"4:35","end":"4:42","text":"and later on we can use that to find out say did our child exit normally or was it terminated in a surprising way"},{"start":"4:42","end":"4:51","text":"so let us run this now and what we will expect to see is that we'll wait for the child to finish before we print I"},{"start":"4:51","end":"4:54","text":"I'm the grouchy parent"},{"start":"4:54","end":"4:55","text":"so let us run this"},{"start":"4:55","end":"5:04","text":"okay so this time the child process got to print out I'm the carefree child"},{"start":"5:04","end":"5:06","text":"then it exited"},{"start":"5:06","end":"5:12","text":"meanwhile the parent was waiting for the async condition and when that happened"},{"start":"5:12","end":"5:17","text":"the parent is able to continue and is able to print I'm the grouchy parent"},{"start":"5:17","end":"5:27","text":"so i want to finish on a common programming error that can really bring down a server"},{"start":"5:27","end":"5:32","text":"and that is suppose we made many many many processes"},{"start":"5:32","end":"5:37","text":"so it is one thing to create a few"},{"start":"5:37","end":"5:46","text":"let's call say fork a couple of times and perhaps you can guess how many worlds we'll see here"},{"start":"5:46","end":"5:53","text":"that's right we see four world"},{"start":"5:53","end":"6:01","text":"and in fact the parent finished early so this is the hash of the terminal saying what would you like to do now"},{"start":"6:01","end":"6:04","text":"but we had four processes all printing out world"},{"start":"6:04","end":"6:10","text":"and if we had three forks now we have eight"},{"start":"6:10","end":"6:18","text":"okay so let us make something now called a fork bomb which is where we keep creating lots and lots of processes"},{"start":"6:18","end":"6:23","text":"and this often happens by accident by people who are new to systems programming"},{"start":"6:23","end":"6:33","text":"but just for fun because i am just doing this inside a browser it doesn't matter if i bring my little virtual machine to a halt"},{"start":"6:33","end":"6:35","text":"i can always just reload the page"},{"start":"6:35","end":"6:40","text":"so let us print out my id"},{"start":"6:40","end":"6:50","text":"i will put this in a little loop that says while one let us fork"},{"start":"6:50","end":"6:54","text":"let us print out my process id"},{"start":"6:54","end":"6:58","text":"and then i will sleep two seconds"},{"start":"6:58","end":"7:05","text":"so initially i have two processes"},{"start":"7:05","end":"7:07","text":"and then each of those processes call fork"},{"start":"7:07","end":"7:08","text":"so we got four"},{"start":"7:08","end":"7:10","text":"and then each of those processes call fork"},{"start":"7:10","end":"7:13","text":"prints it out and sleeps"},{"start":"7:13","end":"7:18","text":"and so every two seconds i am doubling the number of processes that are in my system"},{"start":"7:18","end":"7:19","text":"so that is a lot of processes"},{"start":"7:19","end":"7:25","text":"and in fact pretty soon the kernel will run out of space"},{"start":"7:25","end":"7:28","text":"it won't be able to keep track of any more processes"},{"start":"7:28","end":"7:29","text":"and fork will stop working"},{"start":"7:29","end":"7:34","text":"and now we see here's the kernel printing out all sorts of debug messages"},{"start":"7:34","end":"7:38","text":"desperately trying to make the system stable again"},{"start":"7:38","end":"7:46","text":"as it arbitrarily starts to kill processes in an attempt to recover some memory and space in its process tables"},{"start":"7:46","end":"7:53","text":"so amazingly my little kernel here has managed to recover to the point to where i have a working system"},{"start":"7:53","end":"7:58","text":"but that is fork bombs and you should avoid from accidentally doing this"},{"start":"7:58","end":"8:05","text":"otherwise you will have a system administrator telling you that you cannot log onto that machine anymore"},{"start":"8:05","end":"8:06","text":"okay have fun and i'll see you in the next video"},{"start":"8:06","end":"8:06","text":"bye"}]
